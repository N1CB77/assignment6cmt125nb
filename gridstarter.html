		<h2 class="one">CSS Grid</h2>
		
		<p class="one">I added <strong>display:grid;</strong> to the articles. <strong>display:grid;</strong> activates the grid elements. Without it the grid elements would not work. Then I used <strong>grid-template-columns:</strong> which makes changes to the number of columns stated. I put <strong>repeat</strong> so it would make the same changes to every column availible. I put <strong>auto-fill</strong> which is similar to flex-wrap, all of the boxes will fill in the webpage and flow from ledt to right. <strong>minmax</strong> means the size range that the boxes will change. I used <strong>19rem</strong> which is the minimum width of columns shown in a row and I used <strong>1fr (fraction)</strong> which is how much space the boxes will fill in remaining space. For the sections I put the width as 90% because when I used 100% the boxes did not fully fit inside of the webpage because I had used <strong>grid-gap</strong> in the articles which adds somes space between the columns and added on to the original width, so making the width 90% made the boxes smaller making it fully fit inside the webpage.</p>
